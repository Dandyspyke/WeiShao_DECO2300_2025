OK, so I think the current man usually is like this. I'm not sure whether it's left it because once I click it, there is like it doesn't show any like effect or change. So for example, you can notice I accidentally connect them because I thought I was Only Connect this star, but actually this is also selected. Yeah. So I would say maybe have some.

To let us know what how to say what are the scenes are currently selected would help and also.

I would say currently I feel a little bit.

Complicated. When we want to edit the notes, we need to click the yeah and then click the book first. I kind of feel like 'cause a lot of times we just double click this thing Yeah at the first time. I just want to make it double click. One click and right Click to different, three different Way. But I can do this. It's hard.

But I do think you have a book and also the note is kind of with that kind of ritual page that kind of have helped to increase the mysterious life. But the inaction is still like a little bit. Got it. You maybe can still keep this, but I don't know. Basic as a way more enjoyed it. Yeah.

Got it. So.
Any other questions?

I can ask incorrectly.
OK so the first time I just want to make it.

I want to you can hold the left place left kick and you can go to here but I 'cause I just for the one click, so it will be double.

When I drag it, I might touch its single click or touch it. What should I do?
I chopped it and I can't make it at the same time. OK, And in the same time. So it's hard for me that that's all. Yeah. So that's it. I think that makes more sense. Thank you. No worries.

I got it. I got it. Just the interview and.

Justin, we thank you.

So what's the goal for this testing? I want to know any problem in the project and I want to know if people can find their what they have stored, any planets that they have used. I want to know if.

He can't do or can't do this.

What's your judgment? Can I find? I think he can find. Like you mean I find every note? Yeah, they can find. They can remember what the store calls. Every planets have different color.

But I would say like it's relatively hard to find each stop for the little one. Yeah, that's it.

Anyhow, this is usually just this, just this. Do you have any further plan? Like what will you improve your design based on this? Yeah, I want to just first time I will delete this and I will make it in the stars so you can click it. I remember like currently you only have like me as a participant. So if you do more testing, Oh no, I just test, test him. OK.

He also thinking, yeah, this seems sentences OK, so I'll delete this one and you can click it to just open it and store everything that you want storing it and I will make the connect the line, the blue line to use the right bank right click or but later you are going to realize.

Yeah.

Another.

After all, another cake. Yeah, another cake. OK. Or hold the cake. OK, I will try. And this third one, the third one, I want to, I want to that you can just hold this star, hold the star and just hold it to another place. Hold it to the big place, a big, big * and we can connect each other, OK. And the last one, last one, I'll make it here and do something that you can record what you see in the stars.

That's all. Can you tell me recently? Because currently we click a star or planet and then we click this and then it will show the restored notes. How do you realize that income? Like from the script or OK, you can just show me code and explain it a little bit.
